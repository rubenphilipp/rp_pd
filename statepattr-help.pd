#X text 31 41 This is a helper to store the data of an object with a [savestate] object., f 39;
#X text 31 77 It takes the data from the object the state should be persisted and returns a formatted list suitable for a [savestate] object in its 2nd outlet. The value name to identify the respective object's value is given as the object's 1st attribute., f 39;
#X text 31 183 When the [savestate] object issues a bang (i.e. when its saved values are to be restored) \, the 1st outlet returns the respective value suitable to the object connected to inlet 1 (by identifying the value name in the list)., f 39;
#X text 31 289 The 2nd and 3rd inlets of this object should be connected to the 1st and 2nd outlets of a [savestate] object \, whilst the 2nd outlet of this object should be connected to the inlet of the [savestate] object., f 39;
